        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> Hello, and welcome to my personal website. My name is Gabriela Avila, and I am a current undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Northwestern University.
            My skills extend from various programming languages to manipulation of circuit boards. I am interested in opportunities with software development, hardware engineering, machine learning,
            and artificial intelligence.
